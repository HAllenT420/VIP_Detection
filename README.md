# **VIP Detection Project**

## **Project Overview**
This project aims to **predict which sports betting customers are most likely to become VIPs**. By identifying VIP customers, the business can target them with priority for a **new specific offer next month**, enhancing **customer engagement** and optimizing **marketing efforts**.

The project utilizes a dataset containing **customer features** and a **binary target variable** (`VIP`) to train a predictive model. The predictions are evaluated based on the **Log Loss** metric, which measures the accuracy of probability estimates.

## **Key Objectives**
1. **Train a predictive model** using `VIP_Train.csv`.
2. **Predict probabilities** of customers being VIPs in `VIP_Test.csv`.
3. Evaluate the model using the **Log Loss** metric.
4. Map **predicted probabilities** to **class labels** and discuss their **business implications**.
5. Present the **modeling approach, results, and insights** during an interview.

## **Modeling Approach**

### **1. Data Preprocessing**
- **Handled missing values** and performed **data cleaning**.
- Applied **encoding** for categorical variables.
- Scaled **numerical features** using standardization techniques.

### **2. Feature Engineering**
- Explored **interaction terms** and derived **additional features** based on domain knowledge.

### **3. Model Selection**
- Experimented with several classification models:
  - **Logistic Regression**
  - **Random Forest**
  - **Gradient Boosting**
- Selected the **best model** based on **cross-validation Log Loss**.

### **4. Hyperparameter Tuning**
- **Optimized model performance** using **Grid Search** or **Random Search**.

### **5. Probability Thresholding**
- Mapped **probabilities to class labels** using a **threshold of 0.75**.
- Explained the **business implications** of this threshold.

## **Business Implications**
- Mapping probabilities to class labels with a **threshold of 0.75** ensures the business focuses on **high-confidence VIP predictions**.  
- This approach reduces **false positives**, enhancing **resource allocation** and improving **customer satisfaction**.
